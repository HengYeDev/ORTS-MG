# OpenRails "Ultimate" Train Simulator

This is a fork of [OpenRails](http://www.openrails.org), including [Monogame patch](http://www.elvastower.com/forums/index.php?/topic/30924-going-beyond-the-4-gb-of-memory/page__view__findpost__p__237281) and many other improvements and performance tweaks. 
The master branch is kept in mostly sync with [OpenRails Source Code](https://github.com/openrails/openrails)

## Installation Requirements

Assuming you are running on Windows 10 with recent patch status (version 1809 or higher), there are no separate downloads needed, all pre-requisites such as DirectX and .NET Framework 4.8 are already part of the OS. Same also applies to fully patched Windows 7 SP1. You will need to have an DirectX 11.0 compatible graphics adapter (GPU).

*****
As of [February 2021 and version 1.3.6-ci.9](https://github.com/perpetualKid/ORTS-MG/wiki#2021-02-15-version-136-ci9), we are preparing to move to .NET Core 3.1 framrework, and the launcher will show a message about that. While current versions still are available for .NET framework 4.8, please [install .NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/3.1/runtime) to support future upgrades.
